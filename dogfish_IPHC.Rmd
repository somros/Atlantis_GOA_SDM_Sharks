Explore the IPHC longline data, to get some distributions of spiny dogfish. These will be compared with the distributions that we got from bottom trawl surveys for dogfish.  

Need to look into what this RPN business is.
```{r}
dat <- read.csv('../data/IPHC/fiss_cleaned_09222021.csv')

atlantis_bgm <- read_bgm('../data/GOA_WGS84_V4_final.bgm')
atlantis_box <- atlantis_bgm %>% box_sf()
# utilities
atlantis_crs <- atlantis_bgm$extra$projection
atlantis_bbox <- atlantis_box %>% st_bbox()
```

Check how many data points there are for each species, and which years we have surveys for.
```{r}
dat %>% select(SPECIES_COMMON_NAME) %>% group_by(SPECIES_COMMON_NAME) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n))
dat %>% select(SURVEY_YEAR) %>% distinct() %>% pull() %>% sort()
```

Extract dogfish.
```{r}
#dat %>% select(SPECIES_COMMON_NAME) %>% distinct() %>% arrange(SPECIES_COMMON_NAME) %>%  pull()

dogfish <- dat %>% 
  filter(SPECIES_COMMON_NAME=='Spiny Dogfish' & IPHC_REG %in% c('4A','3B','3A','2C','2B')) %>%
  select(FISHING_EVENT_ID,SURVEY_YEAR,IPHC_REG,START_LAT,START_LON,AVG_DEPTH_M,HOOKS_RETRIEVED,EX_EFF_HOOKS,SUBSAMPLE,OBS_CATCH)
```

View in space.
```{r}
coast <- maps::map("worldHires", c("USA","Canada"), plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)
coast_sf <- coast %>% st_as_sf() #%>% st_transform(crs = atlantis_crs)

dogfish_sf <- dogfish %>% st_as_sf(coords=c('START_LON','START_LAT'),crs=4326)
dogfish_bbox <- dogfish_sf %>% st_bbox()

dogfish_sf %>% ggplot()+
  geom_sf(aes(color=log1p(OBS_CATCH)))+
  scale_color_viridis()+
  geom_sf(data=coast_sf)+
  coord_sf(xlim=c(dogfish_bbox$xmin,dogfish_bbox$xmax), ylim=c(dogfish_bbox$ymin,dogfish_bbox$ymax))+
  facet_wrap(~SURVEY_YEAR)+
  theme_bw()
```

Let's get the fishing events in these Regulatory Areas that did not catch any dogfishs.
```{r}
these_events <- dat %>% filter(IPHC_REG %in% c('4A','3B','3A','2C','2B')) %>%
  select(FISHING_EVENT_ID,SURVEY_YEAR,IPHC_REG,START_LAT,START_LON,AVG_DEPTH_M,HOOKS_RETRIEVED,EX_EFF_HOOKS,SUBSAMPLE,OBS_CATCH) %>% 
  select(FISHING_EVENT_ID) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pull()

dogfish_events <- dogfish %>%  select(FISHING_EVENT_ID) %>%  distinct() %>% pull()

# build a dataframe with events that had zero catch for sharks
no_dogfish_events <- setdiff(these_events,dogfish_events)

no_dogfish_frame <- dat %>% 
  filter(FISHING_EVENT_ID %in% no_dogfish_events & IPHC_REG %in% c('4A','3B','3A','2C','2B')) %>% 
  select(FISHING_EVENT_ID,SURVEY_YEAR,IPHC_REG,START_LAT,START_LON,AVG_DEPTH_M,HOOKS_RETRIEVED,EX_EFF_HOOKS,SUBSAMPLE) %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(OBS_CATCH=0)

dogfish_all <- rbind(dogfish,no_dogfish_frame) # slightly longer than the sum of events, meaning that some events are duplicated. Explore below

dups <- dogfish_all %>% group_by(FISHING_EVENT_ID) %>% tally() %>% filter(n>1) %>% select(FISHING_EVENT_ID) %>% pull()
dups_dogfish <- dogfish_all %>% filter(FISHING_EVENT_ID %in% dups) %>% distinct() # weirdly, it picks up some differences between pairs of these, although they look the same. probably negligible difference
```

View.
```{r}
dogfish_all_sf <- dogfish_all %>% st_as_sf(coords=c('START_LON','START_LAT'),crs=4326)
dogfish_all_bbox <- dogfish_all_sf %>% st_bbox()

dogfish_all_sf %>% ggplot()+
  geom_sf(aes(color=log1p(OBS_CATCH)))+
  scale_color_viridis()+
  geom_sf(data=coast_sf)+
  coord_sf(xlim=c(dogfish_bbox$xmin,dogfish_bbox$xmax), ylim=c(dogfish_bbox$ymin,dogfish_bbox$ymax))+

This is a big dataset with a lot of points. May be worth trying with sdmTMB, the issue is getting a CPUE from the hook counts.

Have a look at the observed catch per subsampling. The metadata say about the 'subsample' field: "Sampling scheme (1=20 hooks counted near the beginning of skate is standard in U.S. reg areas except one year in SEAK for yelloweye; 2=100% hook count is standard in Canadian reg areas)". However, the data contain 0 and 1 as values for SUBSAMPLE.
```{r}
subsample <- dat %>% select(OBS_CATCH,SUBSAMPLE,IPHC_REG)

t <- subsample %>% group_by(IPHC_REG,SUBSAMPLE) %>% tally() # area 2B (Canada) seems to be the only area where there is a prevalence of 0, which I'd interpret as (no subsampling)

subsample %>% #filter(OBS_CATCH>0) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = factor(SUBSAMPLE), y=OBS_CATCH)) # 0 seems to present higher catches, hinting that 0 means no subsampling
```

It seems that if SUBSAMPLE=1 they do the subsampling, i.e. they only count the first 20 hooks. If SUBSAMPLING=0, they count all hooks on the skate. So, if SUBSAMPLING==1, OBS_CATCH=OBS_CATCH*5.
```{r}
dogfish_all <- dogfish_all %>% rowwise() %>% mutate(CATCH=ifelse(SUBSAMPLE==1,OBS_CATCH*5,OBS_CATCH))
```

Not 100% convinced that the adjustment for subsample is correct. Divide by hook number to get NPUE.
```{r}
dogfish_all <- dogfish_all %>% mutate(NPUE=CATCH/EX_EFF_HOOKS)
```

Prepare this for the sdmTMB code.
```{r}
dogfish_all <- dogfish_all %>% select(SURVEY_YEAR,FISHING_EVENT_ID,START_LAT,START_LON,AVG_DEPTH_M,NPUE) %>% 
  set_names(c(
  "year",
  "hauljoin",
  "lat",
  "lon",
  "depth",
  "npue"))

saveRDS(dogfish_all,'../data/IPHC/dogfish.RDS')
```
